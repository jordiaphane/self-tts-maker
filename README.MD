answer a few dialect and orthological questions, record speaking a handful of sentences for the raw converter, all from cmi. or integrate it as data and finetune it using deep learning model, add variations(broad for now, intentionally), alternate between these iterations seamlessly. 

this is personal project. full stop.

the appeal to me, though, is the full conversion of entire e-books into audio files, which would not be convenient in other TTS generative frameworks, to say the least

leaving you, even after only setting up unalterated speech, with text-to-speech converter for large text files into.......your voice? 

the most beautiful voice
